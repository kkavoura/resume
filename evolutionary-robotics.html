				<h2>Summary</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="tab-content hidden">
				<p>During my time at the University of Vermont I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to take a course on Evolutionary Robotics.
					This involved a semester long project in which we had to develop an artificial neural network in Python, which could then be connected
					to a virtual robot created with C++ in Open Dynamics Engine. After creating a functional robot, the goal was to use randomized input
					and have the robot evolve a certain desired behavior. I chose to study the evolution of displacement and compare the results found in 
					quadruped vs hexapedal units.</p>

					<p>Initially, using Python, a hill climbing optimization technique was used to develop a model 
						with the maximum possible fitness over the course of 5000 generations. An artificial neural network was created and subsequently plotted through 
						the use of MATPLOTLIB. The plotted representation is a directed graph with the nodes representing individual neurons and 
						the lines connecting them representing synapses. The two colors represent positive or negative weights and the width represents the magnitude.
						Following this stage, the hill climber algorithm and the artificial neural network were combined, and with a small perturbation in each generation, it
						was evolved to produce result based on a certain fitness function.
					</p>
					<p>In the next stage of the project, using C++ and Open Dynamics Engine a virtual robot was created using a body and then adding limbs,
						joints and finally motors. A randomized neural network and sensors are added to the limbs in order for the robot to be able to tell if
						a certain limb is on the ground or not. Randomly weighted synapses are added to the robot, connecting each sensor to each motor. Despite the 
						randomized neural network, this	will result in the same movement every time a leg touches the ground. </p>
						<p>The C++ and Python codes then communicate through text files in order to connect the hillclimber, artificial neural network and robot.
							The hillclimber creates random synaptic weights which are used in the neural network. The robot then uses these values in the network 
							and 1000 timesteps are run in which the robot moves in a certain direction based on the motions performed. The distance travelled from 
							the point of origin is then returned as the current fitness to the hillclimber via a text file. The values previously sent are duplicated 
							and slightly mutated and sent again for a new iteration.</p>
					<p>This code was intended to run overnight, for thousands of generations, until theoretically a model that has evolve the desired behavior will 
						have occured. I had some technical issues with my computer, which cause the program to crash every few hours, so I never got a a very evolved 
						point in my results. However, I found that the difference from beginning to end was significant and had the code run for as long as it should have,
						the results would have been a lot more drastic.</p>

Each different colored line corresponds to a different iteration of the program. Combining the hill climber with the ANN, we are able to evolve the ANN towards a specific desired behavior.
